Disk scheduling algorithms like FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, and C-SCAN are visualized by the web-based Advanced Disk Scheduling Simulator, which was developed with Flask. Users can enter unique disk access requests and examine how these algorithms reduce the amount of time needed to find a solution. Performance metrics such as system throughput, average seek time, and total seek time are provided by the simulator. For easier comprehension, it also creates a visual depiction of the seek sequence.
