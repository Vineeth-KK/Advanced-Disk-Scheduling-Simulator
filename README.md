Disk scheduling algorithms like FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, and C-SCAN are visualized by the web-based Advanced Disk Scheduling Simulator, which was developed with Flask. Users can enter unique disk access requests and examine how these algorithms reduce the amount of time needed to find a solution. Performance metrics such as system throughput, average seek time, and total seek time are provided by the simulator. For easier comprehension, it also creates a visual depiction of the seek sequence.
Objective of the Project:

The primary objective of this project is to:
•	To understand the effectiveness of the FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, and C-SCAN algorithms in disk scheduling, simulate them by putting them into practice and visualizing them.
•	Minimize Seek Time: Examine how various algorithms minimize disk arm movement to improve performance by optimizing seek time.
•	Give performance indicators. Compute and show the system throughput, average seek time, and total seek time for comparison.
•	Enable User Interaction: For real-time simulation, let users enter their own disk access requests and starting head positions.
•	Visual Representation: To make the scheduling process easier for users to understand, generate a graphical output of the seek sequence.

Scope of the Project:

This project covers:
•	Implementation of Several Algorithms: The project compares the efficiency of the FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, and C-SCAN disk scheduling algorithms.
•	User-Defined Input: This feature allows users to specify their own disk access requests and starting head positions, giving the simulation flexibility and interactivity.
•	Performance Analysis: To assist users in assessing the efficacy of algorithms, the system computes total seek time, average seek time, and system throughput.
•	Graphical Visualization: To improve user comprehension, a seek sequence graph is created to graphically depict disk head movements.
•	Web-Based Interface: Because the simulator was developed with Flask, it is easily navigable via a straightforward web interface.
